# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

###Purpose
    The purpose of this analysis is to gather data on past crowd funding results in order to provide insight into the best crowd funding techniques for Louise, a playwrite, to create her own campaign for a new play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    The Outcomes Based on Launch Date analysis was created to display the outcomes of all theather campaigns by month. It is visualized using a pivot table. All if the data within the main data file (named Kickstart) was highlighted and selected for use within the table. The Outcomes field was placed in the columns section and used for values, Date Created Conversion was aded to the rows, and Parent Category and Years were used as filters.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    The Outcomes Based on Goals was created to provide more insight into the rate of success, failure, and cancelation based on a range of goals set for each previous play campaign. This information could be used to assist Louise in determining the goal she'd like to set for her future campaign and given the information she will be more likely to be successful. The columns were manually labeled and the COUNTIFS equation was used to populate each cell under the Number SUccessful, Failed, and Canceled columns. Then the sum of each row was added for the Total Projects column. Finally percentages were calculated taking the difference of the total successful, failed, or canceled and the total projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
     An issue that arose when creating the pivot table for the outcomes based on launch date surrounded understanding the question that needed to be answered with the table in order to place the correct fields in their areas; however, other than that there were no other issues in completing this part of the challenge.There were no challenges in creating and analyzing the Outcomes Based on Goals. 
    
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    The most successful theater productions were launched in months May and June. 
    The year 2015 had the highest number of successful and failed campaigns. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    Play campaigns with a goal between 20,000 and 24,999 have a 100% suucess rate.
    Play campaigns with a goal set between 1,000 and 4,999 have a higher chance of succeeding or meeting their goal as there are more campaigns that have succeeded within this range.
